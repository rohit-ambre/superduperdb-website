## Integrating AI and applying AI to data is a huge challenge

The AI lifecycle is highly complex, interdependent but fragmented.

![center](images/workflow_logos.svg)

---

## Current solutions highly limit and hamper development and deployment of AI

- Huge operational and infrastructure overhead from injestion to deployment
- Not ready for the latest AI advances since models and data can't talk directly to each other

---

# Data and AI need to be fully united in order to maximize their value

---

# Introducing SuperDuperDB

### The first fully fledged and open source AI-data solution

---

## SuperDuperDB: Integrating AI directly into your data-base, -lake, -warehouse

![center w:500](images/connector.svg)

---

## SuperDuperDB is a unified environment for the entire AI-data workflow

### Computation of new output happens directly on the data - outputs are stored directly with the input data

![center w:900](images/cycle-linear.svg)

---

## SuperDuperDB minimizes overhead and revolutionizes AI capabilities

- Training and deployment of AI models massively simplified
- AI models become easily accessible to independent developers as well as organizations
- AI models can perform entirely new operations by having direct access to all data 
- AI handles new incoming data and streaming automatically

---

## A solution for data people designed by data people

- Train and develop arbitrary AI models without infrastructural overhead.
- Deploy arbitrary AI models to the database and enable unprecedented data navigation and comprehension.
- Models and outputs are kept up-to-date directly in response to incoming data "*perpetuum mobile*"

---

## SuperDuperDB will allow companies to fully own their AI and data stack

### The SuperDuperDB core codebase will be open sourced under Apache License 2.0

- Companies will be able to deploy their AI and models in a unified way in their own data centers.
- Their entire stack will be transparent and no longer locked in behind SaaS and cloud providers.

---

## SuperDuperDB enables a variety of well tested business models

- Tiered managed cloud service
- On premises solution with technical support
- Model repository (like "App Store")
- Consulting
- Certifications

---

## Viral adoption in the developer community 

### Community interest and adoption drives corporate integrations

![center w:400](images/community.svg)

## We aim to make large in-roads into DBMS and managed AI

Both [managed database](https://blogs.gartner.com/merv-adrian/2022/04/16/dbms-market-transformation-2021-the-big-picture/) and [AI market](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-artificial-intelligence-software-market-to-reach-62-billion-in-2022) are already huge and still growing fast

---

## Using SuperDuperDB we will be able to instantly spawn managed services wherever AI provides substantial value

### For example

- Legal tech (*e.g. advanced document analysis*)
- e-Commerce (*e.g. search, navigation, recommendation*)
- Biomedical (*e.g. semantic image segmentation*)
- Cybersecurity (*e.g. fraud detection*)

---

## We will build and offer specialized functionalities for key verticals 

![center w:700](images/verticals-horizontals.svg)


---

## SuperDuperDB is already in full swing

### Progress

- Working prototype v0.1 in Python
- Installable via Python `pip`
- Outstanding feedback from inner developer circle

---

## The founders have a proven combination of skill sets and remarkable joint track record
